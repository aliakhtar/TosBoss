However, you understand that removed content may persist in backup copies for a reasonable period of time (but will not be available to others).

We always appreciate your feedback or other suggestions about Facebook, but you understand that we may use them without any obligation to compensate you for them (just as you have no obligation to offer them).

If you select a username or similar identifier for your account or Page, we reserve the right to remove or reclaim it if we believe it is appropriate (such as when a trademark owner complains about a username that does not closely relate to a user's actual name).

We can remove any content or information you post on Facebook if we believe that it violates this Statement or our policies.

If you repeatedly infringe other people's intellectual property rights, we will disable your account when appropriate.

You give us permission to use and allow others to use such links and content on Facebook.

So we can show you content that you may find interesting, we may use all of the information we receive about you to serve ads that are more relevant to you.\

We also allow advertisers to reach people on Facebook using the information they already have about you (such as email addresses or whether you have visited their websites previously).

If an advertiser chooses to run ads, we serve the ads to people who meet criteria the advertiser selects.

We like to tell you about some of the features and tools your friends and others use on Facebook, to help you have a better experience.

People on Facebook may be able to see mutual friends, even if they cannot see your entire list of friends.

To make it easier for your friends to find you, we allow anyone with your contact information (such as email address or telephone number) to find you through the Facebook search bar at the top of most pages, as well as other tools we provide, such as contact importers - even if you have not shared your contact information with them on Facebook.

Once you share information with your friends and others, they may be able to sync it with or access it via their mobile phones and other devices.

Anyone can add a link to a story.

They may share photos or other information about you and tag you in their posts.

Once you are in a Group, anyone in that Group can add you to a subgroup.

This means, for example, that if you post a comment on a Page, that comment may be used by the Page owner off Facebook, and anyone can see it.

You may be contacted by or receive updates from the Page, such as in your News Feed and your messages.

They may also know when you've made a connection to their Page because you've liked their Page or posted a comment.

We receive information about you from your friends and others, such as when they upload your contact information, post a photo of you, tag you in a photo or status update, or at a location, or add you to a group.

We receive data about you whenever you use or are running Facebook, such as when you look at another person's timeline, send or receive a message, search for a friend or a Page, click on, view or otherwise interact with things, use a Facebook mobile app, or make purchases through Facebook.

When you post things like photos or videos on Facebook, we may receive additional related data (or metadata), such as the time, date, and place you took the photo or video.

We receive data whenever you visit a game, application, or website that uses Facebook Platform or visit a site with a Facebook feature (such as a social plugin), sometimes through cookies.

Sometimes we get data from our affiliates or our advertising partners, customers and other third parties that helps us (or them) deliver ads, understand online activity, and generally make Facebook better.

As described in "How we use the information we receive" we also put together data from the information we already have about you, your friends, and others, so we can offer and suggest a variety of services and features.

When we get your GPS location, we put it together with other location information we have about you (like your current city).

Choosing to make your information public is exactly what it sounds like: anyone, including people off Facebook, will be able to see it.

When others share information about you, they can also choose to make it public.

If someone has your Username or User ID, they can use it to access information about you through the facebook.com website.

Specifically, they can access your public information, along with your age range, language and country.

We use the information we receive about you in connection with the services and features we provide to you and other users like your friends, our partners, the advertisers that purchase ads on the site, and the developers that build the games, applications, and websites you use.

Of course, for information others share about you, they control how it is shared.

We store data for as long as it is necessary to provide products and services to you and others, including those described above.

We may enable access to public information that has been shared through our services.

We may allow service providers to access information so they can help us provide services.

We are able to suggest that your friend tag you in a picture by scanning and comparing your friend's pictures to information we've put together from your profile pictures and the other photos in which you've been tagged.

Other users will no longer see your timeline, but we do not delete any of your information.

Certain information is needed to provide you with services, so we only delete this information after you delete your account.
